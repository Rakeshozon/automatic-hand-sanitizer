# automatic-hand-sanitizer
a DIY automated hand sanitizer using avoid sensor and servo

# purpose of the project
its a kind off DIY project this project took me around 45 min to create from scratch , I got this idea when i was isolated in the covid 19 time and we were spending lot of money of automated sanitizer , thats where i created this DIY automated hand sanitizer 

## working principle

i used the avoid sensor so that its proximity will be moderately good for this project and its cheaper than ultrasonic sensor and it has a good life comparitively to ultrasonic sensor , avoid sensor senses the hand in front of it , and gives signal to servo using arduino nano or uno , and santizer pumps out which already tighed to teh servo
